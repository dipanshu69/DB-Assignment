# Relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category"

The relational database schema includes two tables: "Product" and "Product_Category". The relationship between these tables is a one-to-many relationship, which implies the following:

- A single record in the "Product_Category" table (representing a category) can be associated with many records in the "Product" table (representing individual products).
- Each product belongs to only one category.

This relationship is established through a foreign key in the "Product" table. The foreign key is a column (usually named something like `category_id`) that references the primary key (usually named `id`) of the "Product_Category" table.



# Ensuring Valid Categories

There are several ways to ensure that each product has a valid category assigned to it:

## Database Constraints

You can define a foreign key constraint on the category_id column in the "Product" table. This constraint will enforce that the value in category_id must exist as a primary key value in the "Product_Category" table. This prevents products from being assigned non-existent categories.

## Application Logic:

In your application code (when adding or updating products), you can validate the category_id before inserting or updating the product record in the database. This validation can involve checking if the category ID exists in the "Product_Category" table.

## Default Category:

You can optionally define a default category (e.g., "Uncategorized") in the "Product_Category" table and set the category_id in the "Product" table to this default value if no other category is chosen.
